		# If this is false, BlueMap tries to omit all blocks that are not visible from above-ground.
		# More specific: Block-Faces that have a sunlight/skylight value of 0 are removed.

		# With this set to true, the generated files for this world are compressed using gzip to save A LOT of space.
		# Files will be only 5% as big with compression!
		# Note: If you are using NGINX or Apache to host your map, you can configure them to serve the compressed files directly.
		# This is much better than disabling the compression.

		# Normally BlueMap detects if a chunk has not yet generated it's light-data and omits rendering those chunks.
		# If this is set to true BlueMap will render Chunks even if there is no light-data!
		# This can be usefull for example if some mod prevents light-data from being saved correctly.
		# However, this also has a few drawbacks:
		# - For those chunks, every block will always be fully lit
		# - Night-mode might not work correctly
		# - Caves will always be rendered (ignoring the 'renderCaves' setting)
