# By changing the setting (accept-download) below to TRUE you are indicating that you have accepted mojang's EULA (https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula),
# you confirm that you own a license to Minecraft (Java Edition)
# and you agree that BlueMap will download and use a minecraft-client file (depending on the minecraft-version) from mojangs servers (https://launcher.mojang.com/) for you.
# This file contains resources that belong to mojang and you must not redistribute it or do anything else that is not compliant with mojang's EULA.
# BlueMap uses resources in this file to generate the 3D-Models used for the map and texture them. (BlueMap will not work without those resources.)
# %datetime-iso%
accept-download: false

# This changes the amount of threads that BlueMap will use to render the maps.
# A higher value can improve render-speed but could impact performance on the host machine.
# This should be always below or equal to the number of available processor-cores.
# Zero or a negative value means the amount of of available processor-cores subtracted by the value.
# (So a value of -2 with 6 cores results in 4 render-processes)
# Default is 0
renderThreadCount: 0

# If this is true, BlueMap might send really basic metrics reports containg only the implementation-type and the version that is being used to https://metrics.bluecolored.de/bluemap/
# This allows me to track the basic usage of BlueMap and helps me stay motivated to further develop this tool! Please leave it on :)
# An example report looks like this: {"implementation":"bukkit","version":"%version%"}
# Default is true
metrics: true

# The folder where bluemap saves data-files it needs during runtime or to save e.g. the render-progress to resume it later.
# Default is "data"
data: "data"
