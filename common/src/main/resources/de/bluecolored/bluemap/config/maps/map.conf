# The path to the save-folder of the world to render.
#  (If this is not defined (commented out or removed), the map will be only registered to the web-server and the web-app
#   but not rendered or loaded by BlueMap. This can be used to display a map that has been rendered somewhere else.)
world: "${world}"

# The dimension of the world. Can be "minecraft:overworld", "minecraft:the_nether", "minecraft:the_end"
# or any dimension-key introduced by a mod or datapack.
dimension: "${dimension}"

# The display-name of this map -> how this map will be named on the webapp.
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is the id of this map
name: "${name}"

# A lower value makes the map sorted first (in lists and menus), a higher value makes it sorted later.
# The value needs to be an integer but it can be negative.
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is 0
sorting: ${sorting}

# The position on the world where the map will be centered if you open it.
# You can change this at any time.
# This defaults to the world-spawn if you don't set it.
#start-pos: {x:500, z:-820}

# The color of the sky as a hex-color
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is "#7dabff"

# You can change this at any time.
# Default is "#000000"
void-color: "${void-color}"

# Defines the initial sky-light-strength the map will be set to when it is opened.
# 0 is no sky-light, 1 is fully lighted.
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is 1
sky-light: 1

# Defines the ambient light-strength that every block is receiving, regardless of the sunlight/blocklight.
# 0 is no ambient light, 1 is fully lighted.
# You can change this at any time.
# Default is 0
ambient-light: ${ambient-light}

# BlueMap tries to omit all blocks that are below this Y-level and are not visible from above-ground.
# More specific: Block-Faces that have a sunlight/skylight value of 0 are removed.
# This improves the performance of the map on slower devices by a lot, but might cause some blocks to disappear that should normally be visible.
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Set to a very high value to remove caves everywhere (e.g. 10000)
# Set to a very low value to remove nothing and render all caves (e.g. -10000)
# Default is 55 (slightly below water-level)
remove-caves-below-y: ${remove-caves-below-y}

# This is the amount of blocks relative to the "ocean-floor" heightmap that the cave-detection will start at.
# Everything above that (heightmap-relative) y-level will not be removed.
# Comment or set to a very high value to disable using the ocean-floor heightmap for cave-detection.
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Defaults to 10000 (disabled)
cave-detection-ocean-floor: -5

# With this value set to true, BlueMap also uses the block-light value (additionally to the sky-light) to "detect caves".
# (See: remove-caves-below-y)
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Default is false
cave-detection-uses-block-light: false

# The minimum "inhabitedTime" value that a chunk must have to be rendered.
# The "inhabitedTime" value of a chunk refers to the cumulative number of ticks players have been near this chunk.
# If you set this to a value greater than 0, bluemap will only render chunks that players have visited already.
# Default is 0
min-inhabited-time: 0

# With the render-mask you can limit the map-render.
# This can be used to render only a certain part of a world or ignore the nethers ceiling.
# If you change the render-mask, bluemap automatically tries to update the map,
# including deleting map-tiles which are outside the new limits.
# You can use "/bluemap fix-edges <map>" to fix any remaining issues.

# Please check out the wiki for more detailed information on how to configure this:

# Using this, BlueMap pretends that every Block outside of the defined render-mask is AIR,
# this means you can see the blocks where the world is cut (instead of having a see-through/xray view).
# This has only an effect if you set some render-mask above.
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map.
# Default is true
render-edges: true

# The sun-light strength that blocks at map-edges will recieve if render-edges is enabled.
# Should be a value between 0 and 15
# Default is 15

# Whether the perspective view will be enabled for this map.
# Changing this to true requires a re-render of the map, only if the hires-layer is enabled and free-flight view is disabled.
# Default is true
enable-perspective-view: true

# Whether the flat (isometric, top-down) view will be enabled for this map.
# Having only flat-view enabled while disabling free-flight and perspective will speed up the render and reduce the maps storage-size.
# Default is true
enable-flat-view: true

# Whether the free-flight view will be enabled for this map.
# Changing this to true requires a re-render of the map, only if the hires-layer is enabled and perspective view is disabled.
# Default is true
enable-free-flight-view: true

# Whether the hires-layer will be enabled.
# Disabling this will speed up rendering and reduce the size of the map-files a lot.
# But you will not be able to see the full 3d-models if you zoom in on the map.
# Changing this to false will not remove any existing tiles, existing tiles just won't get updated anymore.
# Changing this to true will require a re-render of the map.
# Default is true
enable-hires: true

# This defines the storage-config that will be used to save this map.
# You can find your storage configs next to this config file in the 'storages'-folder.
# Changing this value requires a re-render of the map. The map in the old storage will not be deleted.
# Default is "file"
storage: "file"

# Normally BlueMap detects if a chunk has not yet generated it's light-data and omits rendering those chunks.
# If this is set to true BlueMap will render Chunks even if there is no light-data!
# This can be useful for example if some mod prevents light-data from being saved correctly.
# However, this also has a few drawbacks:
# - For those chunks, every block will always be fully lit
# - Night-mode might not work correctly
# - Caves will always be rendered (ignoring the 'renderCaves' setting)
# Default is false
ignore-missing-light-data: false

# Here you can define any static marker-sets with markers that should be displayed on the map.
# You can change this at any time.
# If you need dynamic markers, you can use any plugin that integrates with BlueMap's API.
