BlueMap is a tool that generates 3d-maps of your Minecraft worlds and displays them in your browser. Take a look at [this demo](https://bluecolored.de/bluemap). It is really easy to set up - almost plug-and-play - if you use the integrated web-server (optional).

The plugins/mods automatically update your map as soon as something changes in your world, as well as rendering newly generated terrain and managing the render-tasks.

Some features and some blocks are still missing. Especially some tile-entities will not render correctly/at all. See below for a list of what is planned for future releases.

Keep in mind that we have to maintain all new features and keep supporting them in the future.

### Todo / planned features
[Here is a todo-list](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/projects/1?fullscreen=true)! It is ordered by what i right now think is the priority, but it might always change or be reordered at my discretion. *(I develop BlueMap in my free-time, so nothing here is a promise and there are no ETA's)*
